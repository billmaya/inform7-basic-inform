A fruit is a kind of object.

An apple, a pear and an orange are fruits. A fruit has a number called size.

The size of a fruit is usually 4. The size of the apple is 7.

A length is a kind of value. 1m specifies a length. 1km specifies a length scaled up by 1000.
An area is a kind of value. 10 sq m specifies an area.

A length times a length specifies an area.

A fruit has a length. An apple has length 1m. A pear has length 6m. An orange has length 3m.

To begin:
	showme 2 + 3;
	showme 2 plus -3;
	showme 2 - 3;
	showme 2 minus -3;
	showme 4 * 5;
	showme -4 times 5;
	showme 7 multiplied by 9;
	showme 256 / 4;
	showme 440 divided by -10;
	showme the remainder after dividing 17 by 3;
	showme 93 to the nearest 10;
	showme 99 to the nearest 10;

	showme the cube root of 64;
	showme the total size of the fruits;
	showme 2m + 3m;
	showme 2m plus -3m;
	showme 2m - 3m;
	showme 2m minus -3m;
	showme 4m * 5m;
	showme -4m times 5m;
	showme 7m multiplied by 9m;
	showme 256m / 4m;
