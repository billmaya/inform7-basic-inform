To begin:
	showme cosine of 2;
	showme cosine of 2.0;
	showme sine of 0;
	showme sine of 45 degrees;
	showme sine of (pi divided by 4);
	showme sine of (pi divided by 2);
	showme sine of pi;
	showme cosine of 0;
	showme cosine of 45 degrees;
	showme cosine of (pi divided by 4);
	showme cosine of (pi divided by 2);
	showme cosine of pi;
	showme tangent of 0;
	showme tangent of 45 degrees;
	showme tangent of (pi divided by 4);
	showme tangent of (pi divided by 2);
	say "cos x = -1: ";
	let x be given by cos x = -1 where x is a real number;
	showme x;
