To begin:
	showme the hyperbolic sine of 1;
	showme the hyperbolic cosine of 1;
	showme the hyperbolic tangent of 1;
	showme the hyperbolic sine of -1;
	showme the hyperbolic cosine of -1;
	showme the hyperbolic tangent of -1;
	showme the hyperbolic sine of pi;
	showme the hyperbolic cosine of pi;
	showme the hyperbolic tangent of pi;
	say "x = asinh(1.5): ";
	let x be given by x = arcsinh(1.5) where x is a real number;
	showme x;
	say "x = acosh(2): ";
	let x be given by x = arccosh(2);
	showme x;
	say "x = atanh(0.5): ";
	let x be given by x = arctanh(0.5);
	showme x;
	say "sinh x = 1: ";
	let x be given by sinh x = 1.5;
	showme x;
	say "cosh x = 2: ";
	let x be given by cosh x = 2;
	showme x;
